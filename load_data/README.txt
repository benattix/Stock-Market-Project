All data files are in /data/staging/final

Load data lake procedure can be found in /home/w205/W205_Project/load_data

create_crsp_stock.sql and create_financial_suite.sql might not work now that we have .txt files instead of csv which we had previously. Need to figure out how to make it work with .txt files.
