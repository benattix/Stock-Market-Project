# W205 Data Storage and Retrieval 
### Spring 2017 Final Project
### Financial Data Acquisition for Predictive Analysis

## Abstract

This work presents the application of data acquisition, merging, processing, consolidation, storage, analysis and predictive modeling on stock markets. The key research question is **Can the aggregation of stock data improve prefictive performance in conjunction with statistical analysis and machine learning?** 

## Introduction

A single business day hosts millions of trades across a multitude of markets and in terms of data structuring, each exchange is transactional data. Investors also have data for an assets quarterly and annual income statements, cash flow, balance sheets, etc. Additionally, financial institutions, news, and research firms offer qualitative data and analysis which are often presented in grades or ranks. Simply put, the amount of collective information makes the stock market an incredibly complex industry.

Our project proposes building a financial dataset from data acquisition from multiple sources to bypass the cost of financial information systems. With this data, we will perform exploratory data analysis to determine which, if any, financial features or models best predict stock performance.
